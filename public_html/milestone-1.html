    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Identify Qualified Candidates Quickly:</strong> Renay’s main goal when visiting a portfolio is to

            candidate’s skills, experience, and personality align with the job openings she’s recruiting for. She wants
            to
            make

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Evaluate Cultural Fit:</strong> In addition to technical qualifications, Renay looks for signs that

            candidate’s skills,
            experience, and projects related to her focus areas in IT. Certifications or relevant coursework in areas
            like

        <li>
            <strong>Insight into Cultural Fit:</strong> Renay appreciates testimonials, team project details, or any

        demonstrates
        the technical skills, professionalism, and cultural fit required for the roles she is filling. She doesn’t have

        qualifications, allowing her to decide if she should pursue further contact.</p>
